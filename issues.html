<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>I am happy to help you with resolving any issues related to this application. Note, however, that there are quite a few components involved here. So, if you have some difficulties with sending your message, it does not necessarily mean that the problem is with the application. To localise the problem, please follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, check that you can send messages on the mobile provider's web site. It does happen once in a while that these sites go down for various reasons. If you experience problems there, you can contact your mobile provider's customer support.
</li>
<li>Secondly, check that Cabbage Gateway works fine. The best way to verify this is to send a message via their <a href="http://cabbagetexter.com/cabbagewebbased.php">Web based version</a>. Sometimes, mobile providers change their web sites and it takes some time for the Cabbage to catch up. If you experience problems there, you can contact Cabbage developer on his <a href="http://cabbagetexter.com/feedback.php">Feedback</a> page.
</li>
<li>If all the above works, then the problem might indeed be with this application. Please record the issue or question on the GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/mikebl71/websms-connector-cabbage/issues">Issues</a> page and I'll look after it. (You do need to sign up, but that's free.)
</li>
</ol>
