<blockquote><b>THS APP IS DISCONTINUED<br/>Unfortunately, the Cabbage Gateway is no longer maintained. Which means that it is falling apart and no-one is fixing it.
This app can only work if the Cabbage Gateway is working, so I have no other option but to discontinue this app.</b></blockquote>

<p>This is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/websmsdroid/">WebSMS</a> Connector for <a href="http://cabbagetexter.com/">Cabbage Gateway</a>. It's an android app that lets you send free/cheap sms messages via web sites of the following Irish mobile providers: <i>Vodafone, Meteor, Three, Tesco&nbsp;Mobile, eMobile</i>, and also of <i>O2&nbsp;UK, Telenor&nbsp;Serbia</i>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> that, in order to use this application, you must be a customer of one of the mobile providers listed above and be registered on their web site.</p>

<p>This app is an extension to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/websmsdroid/">WebSMS</a>, so you also need to install <a href="https://code.google.com/p/websmsdroid/">WebSMS</a> before you can use this app.</p>
<h2 id="h-overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Most Irish mobile providers allow sending some sms messages from their web sites for free. (Obviously, you need to have a phone from this provider is order to use this service.) However, it is a bit of a pain that you need to use a computer and login to their web site every time you want to send an sms. So some mobile apps were developed that let you access those free web texts directly from your mobile. There is one problem here, however. Provider's web sites are not optimised for mobile usage and are rather verbose. So if you pay for mobile data traffic per kilobyte (which you do on most Pay As You Go plans or while roaming) then you still end up consuming (and paying for) more mobile data than necessary.</p>

<p>The alternative is to use the <a href="http://cabbagetexter.com/">Cabbage Gateway</a>. This is a web service that was developed by one smart Irish guy and that is specifically optimised for mobiles. It keeps communication with mobile phone to absolute minimum. So you really only pay for the size of your message (a small fraction of a kilobyte). The rest of the talking with the provider's web site is done by the gateway on your behalf.</p>

<p>There are several ways to use Cabbage Gateway from your mobile.
This "WebSMS Cabbage Connector" was developed to allow you to send free/cheap sms messages via the gateway using the famous <a href="https://code.google.com/p/websmsdroid/">WebSMS</a> android app. WebSMS is a powerful tool for sending free/cheap sms messages that is used by thousands of people worldwide. A number of connectors were developed to enable its users to use various sms web services available on the Internet. With the help of this Cabbage Connector, you can now use WebSMS to send sms messages via Cabbage Gateway as well.</p>
