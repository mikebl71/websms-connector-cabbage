        <p>This is WebSMS Connector for the Cabbage Gateway. It's an android app that lets you send free/cheap sms messages via web sites of Irish mobile providers.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If you have an Irish mobile phone, you most likely already know that most Irish mobile providers allow sending some sms messages from their web sites for free. But, obviously, it is a bit of a pain that you need to use a computer and login to their web sites every time you want to send an sms. So a number of mobile apps were developed that let you use those free web texts directly from your mobile. However, provider's web sites are not optimised for mobile usage and are rather verbose. So if you pay for mobile data traffic per kilobyte (which you do on most Pay As You Go plans or while roaming) then you still end up consuming (and paying for) more mobile data than necessary. </p>

<p>Then one smart Irish guy developed a web service called Cabbage Gateway. This gateway keeps communication with mobile phone to absolute minimum. So you only pay for the size of your message (a small fraction of a kilobyte). The rest of the talking with the provider's web site is done by the gateway on your behalf. You can read more about this service <a href="http://cabbagetexter.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are several ways to use Cabbage Gateway from your mobile. This WebSMS Cabbage Connector app is developed to allow you to send free/cheap sms messages via Cabbage Gateway from the famous WebSMS app. WebSMS is a powerful tool for sending free/cheap sms messages that is used by thousands of people worldwide. A number of connectors was developed to enable its users to use various sms web services available on the Internet. With the help of Cabbage Connector, you can now use WebSMS to send sms messages via Cabbage Gateway as well.</p>
