  WebSMS: Cabbage Connector
  =========================

This is WebSMS Connector for Cabbage Gateway.
It lets you send free/cheap sms messages via websites of the following Irish mobile providers: Vodafone, Meteor, Three, Tesco Mobile, and eMobile.
This app uses Cabbage Gateway to minimise mobile data traffic.

UPDATE: THIS APP IS DISCONTINUED.

Unfortunately, the Cabbage Gateway is no longer maintained. Which means that it is falling apart and no-one is fixing it.
This app can only work if the Cabbage Gateway is working, so I have no other option but to discontinue this app.
